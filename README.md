# Description of Dedale Toolbox

This toolbox contains two packages that were designed in the context of workpackage 3 of the DEDALE FET-OPEN project (<http://dedale.cosmostat.org>):

- SparseCoupledDictionaryLearning is a package authored by Konstantina Fotiadou, Greg Tsagkatakis, Nancy Panousopoulou from FORTH institute. The purpose of this software is to perform spectral super-resolution in a coupled dictionary learning framework using sparsity.

- pyRestoreManifold is a package authored by JÃ©rome Bobin (CEA), that allows to solve some restoration problems (denoising, inpainting) for manifold-valued data. 

Two python notebooks illustrate how to use these  packages. See the documentation in each package for more details
